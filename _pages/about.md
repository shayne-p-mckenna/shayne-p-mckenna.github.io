Hi, I'm Shayne. 

I received my M.S. in Remote Sensing & Geospatial Sciences from [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu/earth/) in May 2025, and my Bachelor's in Geosciences from [Princeton University](https://geosciences.princeton.edu/) in 2018.

In my free time, I like to hike and wilderness backpack, read fantasy, science fiction, and books about the natural world, try new food & drink, and play RPGs.

Feel free to reach out to me via email at shaynepmckenna [at] gmail [dot] com. I'm happy to chat and connect!
